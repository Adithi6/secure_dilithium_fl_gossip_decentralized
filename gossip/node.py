# gossip/node.py
#
# GossipNode wraps a FederatedClient and adds:
#   - own_submission : this node's signed update (set after sign_update())
#   - inbox          : all verified updates received via gossip from peers
#   - receive_gossip : called by GossipProtocol when a peer forwards a message
#
# The server collects submissions from node.get_all_submissions() instead of
# directly from clients — it gets everything the gossip network propagated.
#
# Nothing in FederatedClient changes.  GossipNode is a pure wrapper.
